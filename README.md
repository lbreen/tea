# Tea?!

## An app for organising rounds of tea (or coffee, if you're in to that sort of stuff...)

Tea?! enables groups, whether they be families, colleagues, or friends, to better organise their rounds of hot drinks. Drinking hot drinks is an invaluable past time for many people, particularly the British, as anything can be solved with a good brew! â˜• 

A user is able to send a notification to a group that the kettle is on and users can respond if they would like a drink themselves. The app will then notify the original user of all the drink requests and the preferences of each user.
